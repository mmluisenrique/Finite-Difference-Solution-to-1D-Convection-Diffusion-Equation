# Finite-Difference-Solution-to-1D-Convection-Diffusion-Equation
In this repository you can find scripts to solve dimensionless 1D convection-diffusion using finite difference method. Moreover, the least square script is to estimate peclet number by fitting the model to experimental data. Formulation and discretization are provided in the pdf file.
